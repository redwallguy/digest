This set of python programs creates the framework for a daily Meme Digest.

The digest contains code to respond to requests for new content in the digest, as well as responds to commands to return the top post from a subreddit.

The rest of the code deals with daily posting of the digest to imgur and subsequent posting to the discord channels subscribed to the Meme Digest.
