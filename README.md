This set of python programs creates the framework for a daily Meme Digest.

metamaker.py reads the Meme_subs_compact.txt file, pulls subreddit names, and creates the code for the digest itself.

The digest contains code to respond to requests for new content in the digest, as well as responds to commands to return the top post from a subreddit.

The rest of the code deals with daily posting of the digest to imgur and subsequent posting to the discord channels subscribed to the Meme Digest.
